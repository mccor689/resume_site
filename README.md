## How to run the site

##### Recommended: create a new folder
In terminal:

    ```
    cd <path to folder>
    ```

In desired file location, run these commands

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/mccor689/resume_site
    cd resume_site/backend
    npm install express | npm install axios | npm install cheerio | npm install cors | npm install child_process
    pip install pygame
    node backend.js
    ```
    
The final command "node backend.js" will start the backend server on your computer, and to stop running the server press "ctrl-c" or close the terminal.

#### Showing the page

After the terminal commands have been executed, open the file explorer and open /resume_site/frontend/front.html.  This file will open on a web browser and can be viewed.
